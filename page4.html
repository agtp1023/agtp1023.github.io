<body><p>Growing up on MDI there wasn't a lot of options for work.  It was either working in a summer shop, or lobstering. However I was lucky enough to have a friend named Drew Rich who owned his own lobster boat.  The hours for lobstering were very important for my summers.  I woke up at 4:30am to get on the boat and start hauling traps by 5-5:30.  We would haul until eleven or noon. This allowed me to have a ton of free time in the afternoons to hang out with friends.

<body><p>For school, I attended Pemetic for both elementary and Middle school.  Then I went on to MDIHS for Highschool.  Now I'm attending UMO as a business student. </body</p>
